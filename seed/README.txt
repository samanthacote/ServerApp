In order to run code you need to download both a mongoDB server, and npm i so that you have the mongo npm module. 
You'll need to start up mongo in your terminal by typing 'mongod'.
Once mongo is running, you can initially seed the database by running
'npm run seed'. This only needs to be done once, unless you drop the database.
You should be able to see your initial seeding in a visualizer like RoboMongo
Then, you should be able to npm start and start up your server!
